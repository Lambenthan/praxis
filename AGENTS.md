# Fishes (desktop)

Brand name: **Fishes** — "An AI workbench for social-science research. Your
partner from question to submission." (Bundle identifier stays
`com.ai4s.workbench` and internal `@ai4s/*` package names are unchanged —
display branding only. Forked from the MIT `open-science` base; that lineage
is recorded in `UPSTREAM_FREEZE.txt`, this is the product's own brand.)

Project rules and working context for AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.).
`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file — edit only `AGENTS.md`.

## Design principles

Keep it **simple, explicit, clear, complete**.

- **Simple** — no over-engineering; if not necessary, do not add entities.
- **Explicit** — no ambiguity; no bugs.
- **Clear** — understandable at a glance.
- **Complete** — cover the key points; prioritize safety.

## What this project is

An open-source, local-first, model-agnostic, reproducible AI research workbench
for macOS and Windows. See `README.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, and `docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`.

Recommended stack: **Tauri 2 + React + TypeScript + Vite**, Tailwind + Radix UI,
**OpenCode** as the agent runtime (bundled single-binary sidecar; HTTP + SSE API),
local workspace + SQLite + JSONL provenance.

## Repository map

- `apps/desktop/` — Tauri + React desktop shell (`src/` frontend, `src-tauri/` Rust).
- `packages/` — `ui`, `shared`, `sdk` (the `OpenCodeClient` wrapper).
- `runtime/` — `manager`, `opencode-profile`, `mcp`, `skills`.
- `docs/` — product and technical specs.
- `examples/bci-trends/` — the built-in demo project.
- `scripts/` — release and dev scripts.

## Architecture guardrails

- The UI never calls OpenCode directly — it goes through `packages/sdk` (`OpenCodeClient`).
  Pin the OpenCode version (see `OPENCODE_VERSION`) and bundle it as a sidecar.
- Keep the frontend, desktop shell, and agent runtime decoupled.
- Skills, MCP servers, and model providers must stay pluggable.
- Keep the artifact schema and workflow templates stable and versioned.

## Safety defaults (non-negotiable for the desktop)

- The agent may only access the current workspace.
- Command execution, file deletion, dependency install, and remote connections
  require approval (manual approval mode by default — never ship `off`).
- API keys are stored **locally, in an owner-only app-private file** (the
  OpenCode profile under the app data dir; dir `0700`, file `0600` — see
  `runtime.rs::tighten_private`). They never go into the workspace, provenance,
  logs (redacted — `debug_log.rs::redact`), crash reports, git, or exported
  projects. (OS-keychain storage is a possible future hardening, not yet done —
  do not claim it.)

## Working conventions

- Default working language for discussion is Chinese; **all project files and
  code are in English** (this is a pure-English project).
- One progress file: `PROGRESS.md`. Append one line per real milestone,
  `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` + a one-sentence conclusion, newest on top. Results and
  blockers only.
- Avoid adding new Markdown docs unless requested — too many docs become debt.
- Prefer minimal, verifiable changes; every step should produce a checkable result.
- Do not write inferences as verified facts; tie conclusions to code or data.
